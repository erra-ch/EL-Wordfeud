# EL-Wordfeud
Fullstack wordfeud project using Java Spring Boot and ReactJS Typescript.

## Roadmap
1. Create base game components and logic in pure Java.
2. Use Spring to explore what improvements can be made, such as dependency injection and testing. Also create REST API to expose an interface to the application.
3. Create functional front-end and deploy everything to Erra's personal server and domain. Prepare for future development by setting up proper CI/CD pipeline.
4. Finish front-end and fine-tune.
5. Explore alternative solutions and extra functionality. E.g.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Web Sockets  
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Chromecast the 'bigscreen view' of the board
